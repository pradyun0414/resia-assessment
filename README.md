# Resia Assessment

A simple AI-powered collaborative image gallery made for the Resia technical assessment with Amplify. The images are hosted on an AWS S3 bucket, and AI image recognition is done using AWS Rekognition. The mosaic layout is achieved using react-masonry-css.

# Usage

Upload images using the file upload prompt (up to 3 at a time), and then rename or delete them as needed using the card interface for each image. Hover over each card to view an AI generated caption detailing the image.
